        <li><h3>Masks</h3></li>
        <p> here is some nice mask where you can purchase some products</p>
          <a href="url">https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=masks&ref=nb_sb_noss</a>
        <p> You should buy masks because covid-19 is tansmutable even when <br>
          it does not show symptoms of itself and since the virus takes 2 weeks<br>
          to show symptoms, a person could go around giving everybody it by simply<br>
          breathing on around them. Also you are unable to tell if someone has it<br>
          because it affects everyone in different ways. For example, someone could<br>
          show no signs of symptoms but could still have the virus </p>
        
        <li><h3>Gloves</h3></li>
        <p>Here are some gloves and why you should buy them. </p>
        <a href="url">https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=gloves&ref=nb_sb_noss_1</a>
        <p> Buying gloves is useful during covid-19 because it has some protection<br>
          against, this is more important for those who have the virus or those who<br>
          leave their house for a long period of time.
          
        </p>
        <li><h3>Face shields</h3></li>
        <p>Here are some face shields and why you should buy them. </p>
        <a href="url">https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=face+shield+mask&crid=31M15F4VEQWAV&sprefix=face+sheild+mas%2Caps%2C185&ref=nb_sb_ss_sc_1_15</a>
        <p> If you are unable to buy face masks because they are sold out or what not,<br>
          you should buy face shields. Although they may look a bit weird, having protection<br>
          on your face is mandatory and these are better than face masks because they cover <br>
          your entire face so you can't touch your face by accident and helps prevent the <br>
          chances of you getting covid-19 better than the items mentioned above.

        <li><h3>Gowns</h3></li>

        <p> There are 2 types of gowns that can be purchased. The first one is called a isolation<br>
          gown and these are used to protect health care providers and also protect people visting<br>
          patients at a hospital because they prevent the trasnfer of microorangisms and body fluids <br>
          in patient isolation sitautions. The other type of gown is called a Surgical gown and is used<br>
          by health care workers when working in a sterile enviornment.
